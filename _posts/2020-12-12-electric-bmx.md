We've updated our list just in time for the New Year! There are some major players entering the electric BMX space and we are excited for what will be the first year of the proper electric BMX bikes

Here is the list of our top 4 BMX electric bikes for 2021!

## 1. CLIFTN Prototype 1 ##

OK, so we might be a little biased here, but of course we think our Prototype 1 is the most proper electric BMX bike.  We'll start taking in pre-orders in early 2021 so stay tuned on our website for more details.

## 2. Zooz UU 250 ##

The guys over at [Zooz](https://zoozbikes.com/) really hit it out of the park with their UU seris of electric BMX-style bikes. UU stands for Urban Ultralight, although the bike weighs in at a hefty 44.1 lbs. The classic style is undeniable though, and the video content on their site is pretty great, showing some riders launch gaps, rip burnouts, and even nose-wheelie with the front disc brakes. They hide the battery under the motocross style seat and utilize a rear hub-motor, not sure if it is geared or not.  Either way these guys are killing it, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next!

## 3. Urban Drivestyle UDX ##

[Urban Drivestyle](https://urbandrivestyle.com) is an interesting BMX-style fat-tire bike coming out of Germany. Their system has front suspension which is interesting, although it wouldn't be my personal preference. They have a great video on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8E26Fh9qKHHz9_tx6pQjxg) that shows some riders sessioning their bikes at skateparks and other fun-looking locations. They offer a number of different configurations and options on their site, check them out, there is definitely some cool stuff coming from this team.

## 4. Enki Billy ##

The [Billy](https://enkicycles.com/products/billy-ebike) was the winner of our [2020 list](https://cliftn.blogspot.com/p/electric-bmx.html), so you can see how much things have changed in 1 year! We still consider the Billy as the first real modern electric BMX bike, but things are moving pretty quickly in this field and competitors are cropping up left and right. It looks like they are currently sold out of this model, as many other companies are, so it seems like sales of this special bike are doing well.
