We've updated our list just in time for the New Year! There are some major players entering the electric BMX space and we are excited for what will be the first year of the proper electric BMX bikes

Here is the list of our top 4 BMX electric bikes for 2021!

## 1. CLIFTN Prototype 1 ##

OK, so we might be a little biased here, but of course we think our Prototype 1 is the top proper electric BMX bike.  We'll start taking in pre-orders in early 2021 so stay tuned on our website for more details.
